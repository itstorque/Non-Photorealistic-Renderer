# Non-Photorealistic Renderer
Processes images and converts them into de-tailed multi-layered paintings with the ability to interpolate and incorporate de-sign styles from a reference image. See [write-up](write-up/6_865_Final_Project_Report_Tareq.pdf) for details of the algorithm and some examples below:

<table>
<tr>
<td> <img src="./Input/unsplash_photos/unsplash_3.png"  alt="1" width = 100%></td>

<td><img src="./Input/unsplash_photos/unsplash_3.png" alt="2" width = 100%></td>
</tr>
</table>

NOTE: I do not own any of the images not in Input/photos directory.

To run this code on your own images, follow the test code in [a9_main.cpp](a9_main.cpp) and put in your own images. Run make
